I'll try to answer anything to the best of my knowledge.

Finding word-genres.
Presentation: http://prezi.com/lj95oj0tabk5/finding-word-genres/

Required software (I built all of these from source in my research):
  * Python 2.7 compiled with sqlite
  * numpy
  * OpenMPI
  * mpi4py

Required data files:
  * http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/mxm_dataset.db
  * http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/track_metadata.db

Included scripts:
  * get_tfidf.py - use this to preprocess the data. mxm_dataset.db --> mxm_tfidf.db
  * k_means_mpi.py - main clustering algorithm with mpi
  * k_means.py - sequential clustering algorithm
  * track_lookup.py - tool to look up metadata from track_metadata.db
  * progress.py - progress reporting for mpi4py

Process:
  * first run the raw data through get_tfidf.py
  * run mpiexec -np 16 k_means_mpi.py k output_filename

Notes:
  * database names are coded in the scripts
  * k_means.py was the original script which was morphed and modified into
    k_means_mpi.py. Therefore, a few optimizations were applied to k_means_mpi.py
    which did not find their way back into k_means.py
  * Use at your own risk
